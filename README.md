# Winning-Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.

Aim of this project is to figure out some patterns in the questions from Jeopady dataset that could help win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded here.

Each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy.
